# Webservice-Sailpoint Assignment

Use case:

Onboard a non-authoritative web service connector source application containing the identities’ account and entitlement data stored in a database. Aggregate the account and entitlement data into IDN. And aggregate the user’s associated entitlements depending upon the target API endpoints. Enable the user’s account on this source when his lifecycle state is “Active” in the organization. Disable the same when the user enters “Inactive” lifecycle state. Also, create an account in the source when an entitlement is granted to a new user and add the corresponding entitlement to it.
